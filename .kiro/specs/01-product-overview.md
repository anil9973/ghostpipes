# GhostPipes - Product Overview

## Vision

Yahoo Pipes reborn as a modern, AI-assisted data automation platform that works as both a browser extension and web app. Empowers non-technical users while remaining powerful enough for data scientists.

## Core Philosophy

- **AI as Plumber**: AI builds pipelines, users supervise
- **Offline-First**: Extension works without internet, syncs when available
- **Visual Debugging**: See data flow in real-time through realistic pipes
- **Progressive Complexity**: Simple for beginners, powerful for experts

## Key Differentiators vs Competitors

### vs Azure Logic Apps

- **Simplicity**: No learning curve, AI generates everything
- **Visual**: Realistic pipes, not abstract flowcharts
- **Browser-Native**: No server needed for basic use

### vs Zapier

- **Transparency**: See and edit every transformation step
- **Data-First**: Work with actual data from start, not abstract triggers
- **Ownership**: Runs in your browser, your data stays local

### vs Make.com

- **AI-Driven**: Describe intent, don't assemble blocks
- **Contextual**: Extension understands what you're looking at
- **Free Tier**: Full features in extension mode (offline)
